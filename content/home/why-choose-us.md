If your project has anything to do with **digital** we believe we can ace it.

We are **quick and reliable** and we promise to offer a solution to meet your **business goals** and your **budget**. 

We are based in **London**, but flex our digital muscles **across the UK**, so location is rarely a problem. 

Oh and we like to **keep things simple**, so we wonâ€™t talk too technical (unless you really want us to!)

We typically work to the GDS service manual's approach of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery" target="_blank">agile project delivery</a>:

<ul class="process-list">
	<li id="discovery" class="process-list__item">
		<h3>Discovery</h3>
		A short collaborative phase where we will research the needs of your service users, understand your business goals, identify success criteria and explore technology.
	</li>
	<li id="alpha" class="process-list__item">
		<h3>Alpha</h3>
		A short phase in which we prototype solutions for your users needs. We will be testing with a small group of users or stakeholders, and getting early feedback about the design of the service.
	</li>
	<li id="beta" class="process-list__item">
		<h3>Beta</h3>
		We develop against the demands of a live environment, understanding how to build and scale while meeting user needs. We will also be publicly releasing and testing a version.
	</li>
	<li id="live" class="process-list__item">
		<h3>Live</h3>
		The work doesn't stop once the service is live. Working with you, we will be iteratively improving your service, reacting to new needs and demands and measuring against targets set during earlier phases.
	</li>
</ul>
